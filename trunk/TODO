Fix ast line numbers. Currently they are determined when a node is finally
allocated, but by then the lexer points to the last line that makes up the
node, instead of the first line.

Consider implicitly converting condition values to boolean for statements
like if, while and for.

Consider moving back to parsing input completely before evaluation.
