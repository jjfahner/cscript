Fix ast line numbers. Currently they are determined when a node is finally
allocated, but by then the lexer points to the last line that makes up the
node, instead of the first line.

Consider implicitly converting condition values to boolean for statements
like if, while and for.

Consider moving back to parsing input completely before evaluation.

COM: When building type information, store all FUNCDESC instances for 
dispatch ids of properties. Then enable the argument count check in Invoke.

JSON: Because of a parsing conflict with empty compound statements, JSON
initializers cannot currently be empty. Not a problem, since the same effect
can be achieved using an empty list initializer []. Still, it would be nicer
to fix this.
