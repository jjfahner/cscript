Fix ast line numbers. Currently they are determined when a node is finally
allocated, but by then the lexer points to the last line that makes up the
node, instead of the first line.

COM: When building type information, store all FUNCDESC instances for 
dispatch ids of properties. Then enable the argument count check in Invoke.

JSON: Because of a parsing conflict with empty compound statements, JSON
initializers cannot currently be empty. Not a problem, since the same effect
can be achieved using an empty list initializer []. Still, it would be nicer
to fix this.

Members inserted into Object through the Add function are only checked for
duplicates against the m_members map. This means that it is possible to add
members that exists in the prototype, as long as they haven't been referred
to before Add() is called. It would be nice to think more carefully about
what the semantics should be here.

Do more optimization work.
